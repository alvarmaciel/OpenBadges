## Mozilla BadgeKit

Mozilla BadgeKit is a new set of open, foundational tools to make the badging process easy.

**BadgeKit:**
*Supports key stages in the badging experience including creating, designing, assessing and issuing. 
*Includes remixable templates and milestone badges allowing for easy customization.
*Provides modular and open options (standards) for the community of  badge makers to use and build upon within their existing sites or systems.

BadgeKit is now available in private beta for select partner organizations that meet specific technical requirements. Alternatively, anyone can download the code from GitHub and implement it on their own servers. 

We will continue to add additional BadgeKit features throughout the coming year, including tools to support collecting, sharing and discovering badges.

You can apply for access to the private beta hosted version of BadgeKit at http://www.badgekit.org, or grab the code for each tool from Github today at https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges-badgekit
