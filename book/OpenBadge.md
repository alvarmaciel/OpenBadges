A badge is a symbol or indicator of an accomplishment, skill, quality or interest. From the Boy and Girl Scouts, to PADI diving instruction, to the more recently popular geo-location game, <https://foursquare.com/ Foursquare>, badges have been successfully used to set goals, motivate behaviors, represent achievements and communicate success in many contexts. A “digital badge” is an online record of achievements, tracking the recipient’s communities of interaction that issued the badge and the work completed to get it. Digital badges can support connected learning environments by motivating learning and signaling achievement both within particular communities as well as across communities and institutions.

## Digital Badges vs Open Badges

A digital badge is an online representation of a skill you’ve earned. Open Badges take that concept one step further, and allows you to verify your skills, interests and achievements through credible organizations and attaches that information to the badge image file, hard-coding the metadata for future access and review. Because the system is based on an open standard, earners can combine multiple badges from different issuers to tell the complete story of their achievements — both online and off. Badges can be displayed wherever earners want them on the web, and share them for employment, education or lifelong learning. 

**Open Badges are:**

* **Free and open:** Mozilla Open Badges is not proprietary. It’s free software and an open technical standard any organization can use to create, issue and verify digital badges.
* **Transferable:** Collect badges from multiple sources, online and off, into a single backpack. Then display your skills and achievements on social networking profiles, job sites, websites and more.
* **Stackable:** Whether they’re issued by one organization or many, badges can build upon each other and be stacked to tell the full story of your skills and achievements.
* **Evidence-based:** Open Badges are information-rich. Each badge has important metadata which is hard-coded into the badge image file itself that links back to the issuer, criteria and verifying evidence.

**Open Badges make it easy to:**

* Get recognition for the things you learn;
* Give recognition for the things you teach;
* Verify skills; and
* Display your verified badges across the web.

## What is Mozilla's Open Badges project?

Learning today happens everywhere, not just in the classroom. But it's often difficult to get recognition for skills and achievements that happen outside of school. **Mozilla's Open Badges project** is working to solve that problem, making it easy for anyone to issue, earn and display badges across the web through a shared technical infrastructure. **The result:** helping people of all ages gain and display 21st century skills and unlock new career and educational opportunities.
